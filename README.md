# üß† Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Learning

This project applies **Deep Learning** techniques to predict whether a bank customer will churn (leave) or stay, using the popular **Churn Modelling dataset**.  
I built and trained an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** from scratch with multiple epochs, improving accuracy step by step through backpropagation and optimization.

## üìå Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical problem in the banking and financial sector.  
By applying **deep learning** with an ANN, this project aims to identify customers likely to churn, giving businesses the chance to take proactive measures.

- **Dataset**: Churn_Modelling.csv (10,000 customer records from a bank)
- **Goal**: Predict the `Exited` column (1 = churned, 0 = stayed)
- **Approach**: Build and train an Artificial Neural Network with multiple hidden layers

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Encoded categorical features (Geography, Gender)  
   - Dropped irrelevant columns  
   - Normalized numerical values  

2. **Deep Learning Model (ANN)**  
   - Input Layer: Encoded & scaled features  
   - Hidden Layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation  
   - Output Layer: Sigmoid activation for binary classification  

3. **Training**  
   - Optimizer: Adam  
   - Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy  
   - Batch size: 32  
   - Epochs: 50+ (tuned for best accuracy)  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Training accuracy improved with each epoch  
   - Achieved strong accuracy on validation/test data
